Who is the Horace Mann community? We are a prep school in the Bronx ranging from 3 to 18 years old. On the upper campus there are students from grades 6-12. These students do not interact with each other with the exception of clubs and mentoring. In a social, relaxed envirnoment their is a lack of opportunity to connect with fellow students in different grades. One potential hostile interactions that a majority of HM'ers have experienced is the bus home from school. The 3:15 bus lines create bottle necks of students. Particulary during the early months of school. Many people are effected in different ways. New students are confused and perhaps may miss their bus. Older students are annoyed. This perpetuates a cycle of mild hostility between grades. The lack of signifiers and signage only further excerbates these issues.
