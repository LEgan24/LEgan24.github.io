Who is the Horace Mann community? We are a prep school in the Bronx ranging from 3 to 18 years old. On the upper campus there are students from grades 6-12. These students do not interact with each other with the exception of clubs and mentoring. In a social, relaxed envirnoment there is a lack of opportunity to connect with fellow students in different grades. One potential hostile interactions that a majority of HM'ers have experienced is the bus home from school. The 3:15 bus lines create bottle necks of students. Particulary during the early months of school. Many people are effected in different ways. New students are confused and perhaps may miss their bus. Older students are annoyed. This perpetuates a cycle of mild hostility between grades. The lack of signifiers and signage only further excerbates these issues. 

How to relieve this tension to improve community interactions?
<br>
The buses the take people home from school may seem inconsequential but on an exceptionally busy day an HM student's stress levels can be high. This being said lowering the stess could greatly benefit the community. 

I propose the adding of school walk way signs and information boards. Currently there is only one. But I believe that the 'divide and conquer' method would greatly improve flow and lower bottle necks. Currently there is only one board that directs students to their buses. This board also has about 5-10 bus monitors circling with clipboards. The board is located by the gate from the field. This creates a swell of students. Some trying to get through to their bus. Others looking at the bus sign. And a third group asking for help from a bus monitor. Sometimes mutliple people fall under this category which only further increases the foot traffic. Having two additional signs with at least two bus monitors/security guards at the new boards would help limit the flow from the center of campus. One board outside Lutnik Hall where many buses park, and students gather. An additional board would go outside of Olshan Lobby. This would allow students to come from Tilinghast, Gross Theater, and other to find their bus from the Northern part of the block. The Lutnik hall bus board and Olshan bus board would cater towards high schoolers whereas,  the middle board closest to the field would cater towards the middle schoolers. Allowing more boards would lighten traffic and make the day less stressful for many involved.
<br>
Having two more signs with the appropriate amount of bus monitors would greatly improve the bus system and the community. I think that perhaps even high school students could be the volunteers to help younger students find their buses and learn the system.
