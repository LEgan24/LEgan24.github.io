 Snack Task (Distributor):
Faculty member B walks through the school to Fischer Patio carrying a couple large Fresh-Direct bags full of snacks. Faculty member B brings the snack to Fischer which was a previously communicated location. This is a longer walk but provides a warm place for winter snack and ultimately was a wiser choice for B and the community.
