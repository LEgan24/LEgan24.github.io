## Design Method from the Mind to the People

1. If this works for me, will it work for others?
    1. If you have a brilliant idea that is beneficial to you, will it help other
        1. Perhaps your parents, siblings, or grandparents?
        2. Is it accessible to all? Have you considered the primary audience?
        3. Could it negatively impact someone?

2. Timing 
    a. The brilliant idea is born and also not born in a day
        i. Spending time developing an idea is important
        ii. Like a macron, you can over whisk your ideas
    b. How much time is too little or too much?
        i. Committed to the idea → then go for it
        ii. Done with it → put it on the back burner or in the archive
    c. Spent a reasonable amount
        i. Like a holiday sale if its brilliant spend some time and energy trying it on and out 
        ii. But don’t commit too soon and exhaust yourself
    
3. Work 
  a. Put in the work
  b. Ideate, realize, continue 
  
4. Self Doubt
  a. Don’t!
    i.Reflect personally, if there is a problem what is it specifically
    ii. Ask for other’s opinions without inputting your own insecurities
    iii. Build → Test → Repeat
    iv. You’ve made it!
  b.“Great success” *in Borat voice* 

5. Build
  a. Work on structure aspects
    i.Test
    ii. Collect data
