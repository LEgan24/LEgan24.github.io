Design Method from the Mind to the People
If this works for me, will it work for others?
If you have a brilliant idea that is beneficial to you, will it help other
Perhaps your parents, siblings, or grandparents?
Is it accessible to all? Have you considered the primary audience?
Could it negatively impact someone?


Timing 
The brilliant idea is born and also not born in a day
Spending time developing an idea is important
Like a macron, you can over whisk your ideas
How much time is too little or too much?
Committed to the idea → then go for it
Done with it → put it on the back burner or in the archive
Spent a reasonable amount
Like a holiday sale if its brilliant spend some time and energy trying it on and out 
But don’t commit too soon and exhaust yourself
Work 
Put in the work
Ideate, realize, continue 
Self Doubt
Don’t!
Reflect personally, if there is a problem what is it specifically
Ask for other’s opinions without inputting your own insecurities
