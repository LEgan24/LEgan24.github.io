<h1>What makes something good or bad?</h1>
  <h4>Here I will discuss something that works well in society and something that works poorly.</h4>


<a> Poor design </a>
The first design that I believe has not reached it's maxium potenial is the ketchup bottle. I am referring to the glass bottle (which is better for the environment and more aesthetic). The bottle howeever always creates a sort of vortex that does not allow the ketchup to fall freely. Many times people end up using the closest piece of silverware to remove the ketchup. This usually results in something messy. I think that the bottle opening may not be wide enough. However, making it too wide runs the risk of too much ketchup falling out. An interesting idea of changing the glass ketchup bottle would be adding a small spoon inside of the cap. This would allow for a scoop device within.

Glass Ketchup Bottle (with scant amount of Ketchup at the opening):

<b> Good Design</b>
The second design I will evalute is something I view as a positive design. This design has benefited soceity for centuries. It is the wheel. Wheels could not be designed to be more efficient. Its design can be modified for different usage but it remains a circle/ 2Ï€r. Although in it's many uses circular wheels were not added to luggage until 1972. And for reference the Moon Landing of 1969 came three years prior.


Wheel (Perfection):

The wheel has also varied in many different way. One different ttype of wheel is the omni-wheel. It's applications can be seen in factories on production lines to mmove things along in different diretions. They can also be used on robots if you want them to be able to move side by side. That is if you have a 5th wheel on the base with an already exsisting 4 wheel 2 motor base.
